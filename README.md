Upload 'Individual_para.RData' which contains each individual parameters used for simulation and functions of PD model first.

Extinction probability are calculated individually in 'volxxx.R'


Upload 'pop_para.RData' before 'Probextinct.R' which is for the relationship between extinction probability and innoculation size.

PRCC is calculated in 'PRCC.R', which require results from 'vol102.R', 'vol104.R' and 'vol304.R'

Sensitivity analysis is in 'PQP_SensitivityAnalysis.R'
